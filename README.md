### Hiya ðŸ‘‹
I'm Surge. I'm a 14 year old 'developer' who works in primarily Java & Kotlin, with basic experience in Python.

You can contact me on Discord - Surge#7456

I've pretty much quit anarchy at this point. I don't find it fun anymore, but here's what I've worked on:

The utility mods I've worked on are Paragon, Cosmos, and a 1.8 paid client, Monsoon.

I also make various toy projects, I suggest you check them out :D
