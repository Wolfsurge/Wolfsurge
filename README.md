### Hiya ðŸ‘‹
I'm Wolfsurge. I code in Java & Kotlin, as well as Python (but I'm significantly worse at python). I like to make block game hacks in my spare time. My favourite music genre is Dubstep / Riddim. Thats basically it.

I'm working on: Paragon - A 1.12.2 client that actually has some decent code in it. Also kinda working on Cosmos.

I am learning Kotlin and Rust.
